      We humans need more than that. If we don’t sleep enough, we accumulate
      sleep debt. In this project we’ll calculate if you’re getting enough sleep
      each week using a sleep debt calculator.

      The program will determine the actual and ideal hours of sleep for each
      night of the last week. Finally, it will calculate, in hours, how far you
      are from your weekly sleep goal.
