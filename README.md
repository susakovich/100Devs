<h1>#100Devs Bootcamp - Full Stack Web Development</h1>
<p>This repository documents my progress and projects during the #100Devs Bootcamp, a 30-week program to become a full stack web developer. The bootcamp covers a wide range of topics and technologies, including HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL/NoSQL databases, Git/GitHub, and more.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a motivated and enthusiastic learner who has decided to pursue a career in web development. Before joining the bootcamp, I had some basic programming knowledge but no real-world experience in building web applications. However, I am excited to take on this challenge and acquire the necessary skills to become a successful developer.</p>

<h2>Curriculum</h2>
<p>The #100Devs Bootcamp is structured as a self-paced online program that combines recorded lectures, live sessions, coding challenges, and project assignments. The curriculum is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic or technology. Some of the key concepts that we will cover include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic web development concepts (HTML, CSS, HTTP, etc.)</li>
<li>JavaScript fundamentals (data types, operators, functions, etc.)</li>
<li>Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.)</li>
<li>DOM manipulation and event handling</li>
<li>React components, props, and state management</li>
<li>Node.js and Express framework for server-side development</li>
<li>SQL and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)</li>
<li>RESTful API design and implementation</li>
<li>Authentication and authorization using JWT tokens</li>
<li>Deployment to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, etc.)</li>
<li>Agile methodology and project management tools (Trello, Jira, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Throughout the bootcamp, I will work on several projects to showcase my skills and build my portfolio. Some of the projects that I have planned so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple static website using HTML and CSS to practice responsive design</li>
<li>A JavaScript-based game using canvas and animation techniques</li>
<li>A full-stack CRUD application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</li>
<li>A React-based e-commerce platform with payment integration</li>
<li>A social media app with real-time updates using WebSockets and GraphQL</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the projects will be available in this repository, along with detailed documentation and instructions on how to run them locally or deploy them to the cloud.</p>

<h2>Progress</h2>
<p>I will update this README.md file regularly to track my progress and share my thoughts on the bootcamp. I am also open to feedback, suggestions, and collaboration from other developers who are interested in web development. Let's learn together and make something great!</p>
