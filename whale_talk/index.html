    <h1>Whale Talk</h1>
    <p>
      Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its
      “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’. There are a few simple rules for
      translating text to whale language: There are no consonants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only vowels excluding “y”. The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must
      double them in our program. Once we have converted text to the whale
      language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.
